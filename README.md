# 2.8-TFT-Shield
An Arduino poject - control and use of a 2.8" (240320) TFT with resistive touch panel. Using Matrix Orbital's 2.8" TFT Shield for Arduino's MKR1000 (prototype as of date). All header files necessary are included.

This code contains functions to perform the following operations:
- initialize and configure 2.8" TFT screen (controller: ILI9341)
- display simple graphic functions 
- read screen touches (via resisitive touch driver: TSC2046)
- calibrates touch panel
